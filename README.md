## Problem Definition and Motivation

The traditional guided tourism model presents several challenges, including limited personalization, restricted availability, and high costs, particularly for private tours. Tourists seeking specific attractions often face difficulties as guided tours usually adhere to fixed routes that may not align with individual preferences. Additionally, there is no dedicated platform for connecting like-minded travelers who wish to explore together, limiting social engagement and shared experiences among tourists. This project aims to address these issues by providing a customizable, interactive platform that enables users to discover compatible travel partners and explore destinations based on personalized interests and real-time data.

### 2.1 Existing System
The existing system of guided tourism primarily relies on human tour guides who take tourists on predefined routes. While this provides some level of structure and knowledge sharing, it often lacks personalization, as guides may prioritize popular spots rather than tailoring tours to individual preferences. Additionally, tourists are bound by the guide's schedule, limiting their freedom to explore at their own pace. This dependency on human guides can also be inconvenient, particularly when guides are unavailable or overbooked. Furthermore, hiring a private tour guide can be costly, making it a less accessible option for budget-conscious travelers who may wish to explore more economically.

#### 2.1.1 Limitations of Existing System
1.	**Availability**: Guides typically work within specific hours, meaning tourists must adjust their schedules to match their availability, which can limit spontaneity. If a guide is unavailable during your preferred time, it may force you to alter your plans or miss out on certain experiences.
2.	**Personalization**: Guides often offer one-size-fits-all recommendations that may not cater to your specific interests or preferences. Additionally, some guides may prioritize certain attractions due to personal ties or financial incentives, leading to biased suggestions.
3.	**Convenience**: Relying on a physical guide can be inconvenient, as it requires coordination of meeting times and locations, which might not always align with your travel preferences. Moreover, having to follow the guide’s pace can limit your flexibility to explore places in your own time.
4.	**Expensive**: Hiring a guide can significantly increase the cost of a trip, especially if guides charge high fees for their services. This added expense can strain your travel budget and reduce the funds available for other experiences or necessities.
### 2.2	 Proposed System
The proposed system will allow users to search for attractions in cities using customizable filters, such as activity type or interest, and display relevant results to enhance personalized travel experiences. Additionally, it will facilitate travel partner matching by enabling users to connect with like-minded individuals, while providing detailed attraction information, including maps, weather, ratings, reviews, and notifications for a comprehensive, interactive platform.\
•	**Tourist Module**: Enables tourists to search for attractions by city and category, view descriptions, and get personalized recommendations.\
•	**Travel Partner Module**: Allows users to create profiles and connect with compatible travel partners.\
•	**Attraction Management Module**: Gives administrators tools to manage and update attraction details, images, and categories.\
•	**Rating and Review Module**: Lets tourists rate, review, and upload photos, fostering a community-driven feedback system.\
Together, these modules will create a seamless, customer-centric platform that improves scheduling flexibility, task assignment efficiency, and communication across the entire service process.
#### 2.2.1 Advantages of Proposed System
•  **User-Defined Filters**:
The platform allows users to search by city and choose from categories such as adventure, historical sites, and family-friendly spots, providing tailored recommendations to match each user’s travel preferences and interests.
